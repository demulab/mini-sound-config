If using a Raspberry Pi, follow the process below in order to generate the correct /etc/asound.rc file for your microphone and speaker setup.

1) Run aplay -L
2) This shows a list of devices connected to the Raspberry Pi which are capable of sound playback.  Note down the name shown after 'CARD='.  For example, the build-in raspberry pi sound card is 'ALSA'.

3) Run arecord -L
4) This shows a list of devices connected to the Raspberry Pi which are capable of sound capture. Again, note down the name show after 'CARD='.  For example, the microphone suggested on the Jasper project page, the Akiro Kinobo, is 'Device'.

4) Run sudo nano /etc/asound.conf or sudo nano ~/.asound.conf
5) Replace the contents of this file (it may already be blank) with the following, replacing PLAYBACK_DEVICE_NAME and RECORD_DEVICE_NAME with the information recorded above.

pcm.usb
{
    type hw
    card RECORD_DEVICE_NAME
}

pcm.internal
{
    type hw
    card PLAYBACK_DEVICE_NAME
}

pcm.!default
{
    type asym
    playback.pcm
    {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "internal"
    }
    capture.pcm
    {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "usb"
    }
}

ctl.!default
{
    type asym
    playback.pcm
    {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "internal"
    }
    capture.pcm
    {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "usb"
    }
}

6) Press CTRL+X then type 'y' to save
7) Reboot
